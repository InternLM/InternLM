#### Introduction
InternLM-20B was pre-trained on over **2.3T** Tokens containing high-quality English, Chinese, and code data. Additionally, the Chat version has undergone SFT and RLHF training, enabling it to better and more securely meet users' needs.

In terms of model structure, InternLM-20B opted for a deeper architecture, with a depth set at 60 layers. This surpasses the conventional 7B and 13B models that utilize 32 or 40 layers. When parameters are limited, increasing the number of layers can enhance the model's overall capability. Furthermore, compared to InternLM-7B, the pre-training data used for InternLM-20B underwent higher quality cleansing and was supplemented with data rich in knowledge and designed for reinforcing understanding and reasoning capabilities. As a result, it exhibits significant improvements in understanding, reasoning, mathematical, and programming abilities‚Äîall of which test the technical proficiency of language models. Overall, InternLM-20B features the following characteristics:
- Outstanding overall performance
- Strong utility invocation capability
- Supports a 16k context length (Through inference extrapolation)
- Better value alignment.

#### Performance Evaluation

On the 5 capability dimensions proposed by OpenCompass, InternLM-20B has achieved excellent results (the bolded scores represent the best performances within the 13B-33B parameter range).

**Limitations:** Although we have made efforts to ensure the safety of the model during the training process and to encourage the model to generate text that complies with ethical and legal requirements, the model may still produce unexpected outputs due to its size and probabilistic generation paradigm. For example, the generated responses may contain biases, discrimination, or other harmful content. Please do not propagate such content. We are not responsible for any consequences resulting from the dissemination of harmful information.

## Usage Examples

### Import from Transformers

To load the InternLM 7B Chat model using Transformers, use the following code:

```python
>>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM
>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("internlm/internlm-chat-7b-v1_1", trust_remote_code=True)
>>> model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("internlm/internlm-chat-7b-v1_1", trust_remote_code=True).cuda()
>>> model = model.eval()
>>> response, history = model.chat(tokenizer, "hello", history=[])
>>> print(response)
Hello! How can I help you today?
>>> response, history = model.chat(tokenizer, "please provide three suggestions about time management", history=history)
>>> print(response)
Sure, here are three tips for effective time management:

1. Prioritize tasks based on importance and urgency: Make a list of all your tasks and categorize them into "important and urgent," "important but not urgent," and "not important but urgent." Focus on completing the tasks in the first category before moving on to the others.
2. Use a calendar or planner: Write down deadlines and appointments in a calendar or planner so you don't forget them. This will also help you schedule your time more effectively and avoid overbooking yourself.
3. Minimize distractions: Try to eliminate any potential distractions when working on important tasks. Turn off notifications on your phone, close unnecessary tabs on your computer, and find a quiet place to work if possible.

Remember, good time management skills take practice and patience. Start with small steps and gradually incorporate these habits into your daily routine.
```

### Import from ModelScope

To load the InternLM model using ModelScope, use the following code:

```python
from modelscope import snapshot_download, AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM
import torch
model_dir = snapshot_download('Shanghai_AI_Laboratory/internlm-chat-7b-v1_1', revision='v1.0.0')
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_dir, device_map="auto", trust_remote_code=True,torch_dtype=torch.float16)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_dir,device_map="auto",  trust_remote_code=True,torch_dtype=torch.float16)
model = model.eval()
response, history = model.chat(tokenizer, "hello", history=[])
print(response)
response, history = model.chat(tokenizer, "please provide three suggestions about time management", history=history)
print(response)
```

### Deployment

We use [LMDeploy](https://github.com/InternLM/LMDeploy) to complete the one-click deployment of InternLM.

1. First, install LMDeploy:

```
  python3 -m pip install lmdeploy
```

2. Use the following command for quick deployment:

```
  python3 -m lmdeploy.serve.turbomind.deploy InternLM-7B /path/to/internlm-7b/model hf
```

3. After exporting the model, you can start a server and have a conversation with the deployed model using the following command:

```
  python3 -m lmdeploy.serve.client {server_ip_addresss}:33337
```

[LMDeploy](https://github.com/InternLM/LMDeploy) provides a complete workflow for deploying InternLM. Please refer to the [deployment tutorial](https://github.com/InternLM/LMDeploy) for more details on deploying InternLM.

## Fine-tuning & Training

### Pre-training and Fine-tuning Tutorial

Please refer to [Usage Tutorial](./doc/en/usage.md) to start InternLM installation, data processing, pre-training and fine-tuning.

### Convert to Transformers Format

The model trained by InternLM can be easily converted to HuggingFace Transformers format, which is convenient for seamless docking with various open source projects in the community. With the help of `tools/transformers/convert2hf.py`, the weights saved during training can be converted into transformers format with one command

```bash
python tools/transformers/convert2hf.py --src_folder origin_ckpt/ --tgt_folder hf_ckpt/ --tokenizer ./tools/V7_sft.model
```

After conversion, it can be loaded as transformers by the following code

```python
>>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel
>>> model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("hf_ckpt/", trust_remote_code=True).cuda()
```

## Training System

### System Architecture

Please refer to the [System Architecture document](./doc/en/structure.md) for further details.

### Training Performance

InternLM deeply integrates Flash-Attention, Apex and other high-performance model operators to improve training efficiency. By building the Hybrid Zero technique, it achieves efficient overlap of computation and communication, significantly reducing cross-node communication traffic during training. InternLM supports expanding the 7B model from 8 GPUs to 1024 GPUs, with an acceleration efficiency of up to 90% at the thousand-GPU scale, a training throughput of over 180 TFLOPS, and an average of over 3600 tokens per GPU per second. The following table shows InternLM's scalability test data at different configurations:

| GPU Number         | 8   | 16  | 32  | 64  | 128  | 256  | 512  | 1024  |
| ---------------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ------ |
| TGS | 4078 | 3939 | 3919 | 3944 | 3928  | 3920  | 3835  | 3625   |
| TFLOPS  | 193 | 191  | 188  | 188  | 187   | 185   | 186   | 184    |

TGS represents the average number of tokens processed per GPU per second. For more performance test data, please refer to the [Training Performance document](./doc/en/train_performance.md) for further details.
