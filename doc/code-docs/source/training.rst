Training API
============

InternLM training API is managed in ``internlm.core.trainer.Trainer``. After defining the training engine and runtime scheduler, 
we can call training API to perform training, evaluation, zero gradients and parameter update steps.

For detailed usage, please refer to Trainer API documentation and examples.
