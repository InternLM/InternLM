    --dataset AI-ModelScope/blossom-math-v2 --output_dir output
```

## Inference

### [LMDeploy](https://github.com/InternLM/lmdeploy)

LMDeploy is an efficient toolkit for compressing, deploying, and serving LLMs and VLMs.

With only 4 lines of code, you can perform `internlm3-8b-instruct` inference after `pip install lmdeploy`:

```python
from lmdeploy import pipeline
pipe = pipeline("internlm/internlm3-8b-instruct")
response = pipe(["Hi, pls intro yourself", "Shanghai is"])
print(response)
```

### [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm)

`vLLM` is a high-throughput and memory-efficient inference and serving engine for LLMs.

Refer to [installation](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/getting_started/installation/index.html) to install the latest code of vllm

```bash
pip install vllm --pre --extra-index-url https://wheels.vllm.ai/nightly
```

Then, you can conduct the `internlm3-8b-instruct` model inference as follows:

```python
from vllm import LLM, SamplingParams

# Sample prompts.
prompts = [
    "Hello, my name is",
    "The future of AI is",
]
# Create a sampling params object.
sampling_params = SamplingParams(temperature=0.8, top_p=0.95)

# Create an LLM.
llm = LLM(model="internlm/internlm3-8b-instruct", trust_remote_code=True)
# Generate texts from the prompts. The output is a list of RequestOutput objects
# that contain the prompt, generated text, and other information.
outputs = llm.generate(prompts, sampling_params)
# Print the outputs.
for output in outputs:
    prompt = output.prompt
    generated_text = output.outputs[0].text
    print(f"Prompt: {prompt!r}, Generated text: {generated_text!r}")
```

### [SGLang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang)

`SGLang` is a fast serving framework for large language models and vision language models.

After the installation following the official [documentation](https://docs.sglang.ai/start/install.html), you can conduct the `internlm3-8b-instruct` model inference as follows:

```shell
python3 -m sglang.launch_server --model internlm/internlm3-8b-instruct --trust-remote-code --chat-template internlm2-chat
```

```shell
curl http://127.0.0.1:30000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer EMPTY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "internlm/internlm3-8b-instruct",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Introduce Shanghai"}],
    "stream": false
  }' \
  --no-buffer
```

### [TGI](https://github.com/huggingface/text-generation-inference)

TGI is a toolkit for deploying and serving Large Language Models (LLMs). The easiest way of deploying a LLM is using the official Docker container:

```shell
model="internlm/internlm2_5-chat-7b"
volume=$PWD/data # share a volume with the Docker container to avoid downloading weights every run

docker run --gpus all --shm-size 1g -p 8080:80 -v $volume:/data ghcr.io/huggingface/text-generation-inference:2.0 --model-id $model
```

And then you can make requests like

```shell
curl 127.0.0.1:8080/generate_stream \
    -X POST \
    -d '{"inputs":"What is Deep Learning?","parameters":{"max_new_tokens":20}}' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

### [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp)

`llama.cpp` is a LLM inference framework developed in C/C++. Its goal is to enable LLM inference with minimal setup and state-of-the-art performance on a wide variety of hardware - locally and in the cloud.

`InternLM2`, `InternLM2.5` and `InternLM3` can be deployed with `llama.cpp` by following the below instructions:

- Refer [this](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp?tab=readme-ov-file#build) guide to build llama.cpp from source
- Convert the InternLM model to GGUF model and run it according to the [guide](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp?tab=readme-ov-file#prepare-and-quantize)

### [ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama)

Ollama bundles model weights, configuration, and data into a single package, defined by a Modelfile. It optimizes setup and configuration details, enabling users to easily set up and execute LLMs locally (in CPU and GPU modes).

The following snippet presents the Modefile of InternLM2.5 with `internlm3-8b-instruct` as an example. Note that the model has to be converted to GGUF model at first.

```shell
echo 'FROM ./internlm3-8b-instruct.gguf
TEMPLATE """{{ if .System }}<|im_start|>system
{{ .System }}<|im_end|>
{{ end }}{{ if .Prompt }}<|im_start|>user
{{ .Prompt }}<|im_end|>
{{ end }}<|im_start|>assistant
{{ .Response }}<|im_end|>"""

PARAMETER stop "<|action_end|>"
PARAMETER stop "<|im_end|>"

SYSTEM """You are an AI assistant whose name is InternLM (书生·浦语).
- InternLM (书生·浦语) is a conversational language model that is developed by Shanghai AI Laboratory (上海人工智能实验室). It is designed to be helpful, honest, and harmless.
- InternLM (书生·浦语) can understand and communicate fluently in the language chosen by the user such as English and 中文.
"""
' > ./Modelfile
```

Then, create an image from the above `Modelfile` like this:

```shell
ollama create internlm3:8b-instruct -f ./Modelfile
```

Regarding the usage of `ollama`, please refer [here](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/tree/main/docs).

### [llamafile](https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile)

llamafile lets you turn large language model (LLM) weights into executables. It combines [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) with [Cosmopolitan Libc](https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan).

The best practice of deploying InternLM2, InternLM2.5 or InternLM3 using llamafile is shown as below:

- Convert the model into GGUF model by `llama.cpp`. Suppose we get `internlm3-8b-instruct.gguf` in this step
- Create the llamafile

```shell
wget https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile/releases/download/0.8.6/llamafile-0.8.6.zip
unzip llamafile-0.8.6.zip

cp llamafile-0.8.6/bin/llamafile internlm3.llamafile

echo "-m
internlm3-8b-instruct.gguf
--host
0.0.0.0
-ngl
999
..." > .args

llamafile-0.8.6/bin/zipalign -j0 \
  internlm3.llamafile \
  internlm3-8b-instruct.gguf \
  .args

rm -rf .args
```

- Run the llamafile

```shell
./internlm3.llamafile
```

Your browser should open automatically and display a chat interface. (If it doesn't, just open your browser and point it at http://localhost:8080)

### [mlx](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx)

MLX is an array framework for machine learning research on Apple silicon, brought to you by Apple machine learning research.

With the following steps, you can perform InternLM2 or InternLM2.5 inference on Apple devices.

- Installation

```shell
pip install mlx mlx-lm
```

- Inference

```python
from mlx_lm import load, generate
tokenizer_config = {"trust_remote_code": True}
model, tokenizer = load("internlm/internlm2-chat-1_8b", tokenizer_config=tokenizer_config)
response = generate(model, tokenizer, prompt="write a story", verbose=True)
```

## Application

### [Langchain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain)

LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by large language models (LLMs).

You can build a [LLM chain](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/get_started/quickstart/#llm-chain) by the OpenAI API. And the server is recommended to be launched by LMDeploy, vLLM or others that are compatible with openai server.

```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate

llm = ChatOpenAI(
    model_name="a-model",
    openai_api_key="a dummy key",
    openai_api_base='https://0.0.0.0:23333/v1')
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([
    ("system", "You are a world class technical documentation writer."),
    ("user", "{input}")
])

chain = prompt | llm

chain.invoke({"input": "how can langsmith help with testing?"})
```

Or you can follow the guide [here](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/get_started/quickstart/#llm-chain) and run an ollama model locally.

As for other user cases, please look for them from [here](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/get_started/introduction/).

### [LlamaIndex](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index)

LlamaIndex is a framework for building context-augmented LLM applications.

It chooses ollama as the LLM inference engine locally. An example can be found from the [Starter Tutorial(Local Models)](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/getting_started/starter_example_local/).

Therefore, you can integrate InternLM2 or InternLM2.5 models to LlamaIndex smoothly if you can deploying them with `ollama` as guided in the [ollama section](#ollama)

### [open-webui](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui)

Open WebUI is an extensible, feature-rich, and user-friendly self-hosted AI platform designed to run completely offline. It supports Ollama services and other compatible OpenAI API services, and comes with a built-in RAG reasoning engine, making it a powerful AI deployment solution.

1. You can start an API service with LMDeploy, or launch the service with ollama.
2. Follow the [guidance](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui?tab=readme-ov-file#installation-via-python-pip-)to install Open WebUI, and start the webui service with open-webui serve. Open the webui in your browser.
3. Refer to the [documentation](https://docs.openwebui.com/getting-started/quick-start/starting-with-ollama#step-2-managing-your-ollama-instance). Inside the opened page, find the settings, configure the OpenAI-like services or ollama services. Once configured, you can choose a model to engage in conversation.

### [LazyLLM](https://github.com/LazyAGI/LazyLLM)

LazyLLM is an framework which supports the easiest and laziest way for building multi-agent LLMs applications. It offers extremely high flexibility and ease of use compared to LangChain and LLamaIndex.

When you have installed `lazyllm` by `pip3 install lazyllm` and `lazyllm install standard`, you can use the following code to build chatbots based on internLM at a very low cost, without worrying about the special tokens (such as `<|im_start|>system` and `<|im_end|>`) of the dialogue model. Don’t worry about not having weight files; as long as you are connected to the internet, the code below will automatically download the weight files and deploy the service for you. Enjoy the convenience that LazyLLM brings to you.

```python
from lazyllm import TrainableModule, WebModule
# Model will be download automatically if you have an internet connection
m = TrainableModule('internlm2_5-7b-chat')
# will launch a chatbot server
WebModule(m).start().wait()
```

You can use the following code to finetune your model if needed. When the trainset (The dataset needs to be downloaded to the local machine, for example:[
alpaca_gpt4_zh](https://huggingface.co/datasets/llamafactory/alpaca_gpt4_zh)) of the TrainableModule is set, during the calling of the WebModule's update function, the TrainableModule will be automatically fine-tuned, and then both the TrainableModule and the WebModule will be deployed separately.

```python
from lazyllm import TrainableModule, WebModule
m = TrainableModule('internlm2-chat-7b').trainset('/patt/to/your_data.json').mode('finetune')
WebModule(m).update().wait()
```

It is worth mentioning that regardless of which model in the InternLM series you use, you can perform inference and fine-tuning with LazyLLM. You don't need to worry about the model's segmentation strategy or special tokens.<br>
If you want to build your own RAG application, you don't need to first start the inference service and then configure the IP and port to launch the application like you would with LangChain. Refer to the code below, and with LazyLLM, you can use the internLM series models to build a highly customized RAG application in just ten lines of code, along with document management services (The document requires specifying the local absolute path. You can download it as an example from here: [rag_master](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Jing0o0Xin/rag_master)):
