# InternLM2-1.8B Model Card

## Introduction

InternLM2-1.8B is the 1.8 billion parameter version of the second generation InternLM series. In order to facilitate user use and research, InternLM2-1.8B has three versions of open-source models. They are:

- InternLM2-1.8B: Foundation models with high quality and high adaptation flexibility, which serve as a good starting point for downstream deep adaptations.
- InternLM2-Chat-1.8B-SFT: Chat model after supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on InternLM2-1.8B. 
- InternLM2-Chat-1.8B: Further aligned on top of InternLM2-Chat-1.8B-SFT through online RLHF. InternLM2-Chat-1.8B exhibits better instruction following, chat experience, and function calling, which is recommended for downstream applications.

The base model of InternLM2 has the following technical features:

- Effective support for ultra-long contexts of up to 200,000 characters: The model nearly perfectly achieves "finding a needle in a haystack" in long inputs of 200,000 characters. It also leads among open-source models in performance on long-text tasks such as LongBench and L-Eval.
- Comprehensive performance enhancement: Compared to the previous generation model, it shows significant improvements in various capabilities, including reasoning, mathematics, and coding.
